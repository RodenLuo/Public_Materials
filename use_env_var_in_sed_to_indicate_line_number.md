I searched [this](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/69112/how-can-i-use-variables-when-doing-a-sed) 
when I want to indicate the line number in sed by env variable.

Then find `sed '${e}s/$/\tmd:i:1/g' file.txt` does not work.

But using double quotes works `sed "${e}s/$/\tmd:i:1/g" file.txt`
